Greetings! I'm the creator of this application, Timothy Ross. Here's how you get it to work!

If these steps are not done correctly, I can make no guarantee that the program will run. 
First off, download this file: 
https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.basics.tsv.gz
This is the whole dataset. 

Next, search it for all movies and save it as a file named MovieInfo. 
You can do this by using the command:
grep '	movie	' $$$ > MovieInfo.txt

where $$$ is the path to wherever you chose to save the whole dataset.

Now a file named MovieInfo.txt will be saved in your home directory.

Keep track of this, you'll need it for later.

Now, run the program once to generate the files in your home directory, place MovieInfo.txt into the directory MovieData.

Now run the program again!

Now you can follow the on screen prompts to run the program.

At the start, you have to log in a user in order to start modifying catalogs.
So, the first thing you should do is create a user by typing the number listed on the screen. You should be able to use a 50 character username.
